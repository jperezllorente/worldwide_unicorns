# Analyzing Unicorns arounf the world

I've always been very interested in the starup world. The innovation, cool founders and breaking with everything that was established in the working paradigm inspired me to think about the wonderful things I could create. I still haven't created anything of the likes but I wanted to have a deeper understanding of this enviroment. 

In this project I've used Maven Analytics dataset of Globla Unicorns with the objective of answering the following questions: 
 
- What are the most valued companies of the moment?
- What are the investors with the greatest number of investments?
- What industries have recevied the most funding?
- What industries have the most valued companies?
- Relation between funding and valuation?

To clean, prepare and make a first analysis of the dataset I used Pandas, and to the dislay the final result I've used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard.
